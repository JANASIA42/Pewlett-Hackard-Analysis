# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide insight into the number of employees retiring in the near future compared to the number of employees who would be eligible as a mentee, in preparation to become a manager.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
- Somehow, there are no employees at this company who were born after 1965.

- If filtering by birth year for only employees born in 1965, the number of employees who are close to retirement far exceeds the number of employees eligible for a mentorship.

- The company should immediately start hiring younger, qualified employees; not only to stay in existence long-term, but also to avoid potential age discrimination law suits, and to invite fresh perspectives into their operating procedures.  

- There are no eligible mentees in management positions.

- The groups with the largest number of retiring employees are the Senior Engineers, followed by the Senior Staff.

## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Over 72,000 roles will need to be filled to accommodate attrition.


### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Yes; there are more than enough.  Depending on the title, the number of soon-to-be-retirees ranges anywhere from ten, to several hundred times greater than the number of prospective mentees with the same title.

### Two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
- In order to equalize the number of prospective mentees and retirees/mentors, the age range should be expanded to include all employees born in 1962 or later in the eligible_mentees table.
- An additional table to show the number of employees eligible to become managers vs. the current number of managers would be helpful.  The filter for the management mentees could be the start date (i.e., employees who've worked at Pewlett Hackard the longest but who are not yet in management positions could have priority as candidates for a management mentorship program.
